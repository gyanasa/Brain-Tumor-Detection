# Brain Tumor Classification using Pretrained EfficientNet-B0 Model

This Python script utilizes a pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model for classifying brain tumor images. The script employs transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained weights of EfficientNet-B0, fine-tuning it on a dataset of brain tumor images for classification.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- EfficientNet (if not included in TensorFlow version)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2) for image preprocessing (optional)

## How to Use
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Prepare your dataset of brain tumor images. Organize them into appropriate directories for training, validation, and testing.
3. Adjust hyperparameters and settings in the script, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., as needed.
4. Run the script.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training, validation, and testing should consist of brain tumor images categorized into classes (e.g., tumor vs. non-tumor). It is recommended to have a balanced dataset with a sufficient number of samples in each class for effective model training.

## Model Fine-Tuning
The script fine-tunes a pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model on the provided dataset. Fine-tuning involves freezing certain layers of the pre-trained model and training only the top layers or specific blocks to adapt the model to the new task of brain tumor classification.

## Performance Evaluation
The script evaluates the performance of the trained model on a separate test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, it may generate confusion matrices or classification reports to provide further insights into the model's performance.

## Customization
Users can customize the script by modifying the model architecture, adjusting data augmentation techniques, experimenting with different optimizers or learning rates, or incorporating additional layers for feature extraction or classification.

## Pretrained Models
EfficientNet-B0 is used as the pretrained model in this script. However, users can experiment with other pretrained models available in TensorFlow or Keras for comparison or improved performance.
